Great choice of article! I also found “Getting A Computer Science Job In The Sports Industry” (https://www.jamiefosterscience.com/computer-science-jobs-in-sports/) really insightful. As someone passionate about both sports and computer science, I appreciated how the article breaks down the diverse opportunities available—from data analytics and software engineering to UI/UX roles and IT operations.

Your summary does a good job of highlighting the intersection between these two fields. I especially liked that the article points out the importance of both technical and soft skills, as well as the value of having a genuine passion for sports when pursuing a tech career in this industry. It’s encouraging to know that there are so many paths that let us contribute to sports using our CS knowledge!

Thanks for sharing this—I’m now even more excited about exploring tech roles in the sports world.
